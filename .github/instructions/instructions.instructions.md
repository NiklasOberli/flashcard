❌ Never use && in PowerShell (that's Bash syntax)
✅ Use ; for command chaining

📚 Before implementing any feature or making changes:
1. Always read the README.md file first
2. Read relevant documentation in the docs/ folder if necessary
3. Understand the existing architecture and patterns before coding
4. Don't just add new files without considering existing structure, add to existing files when possible

✅ Task Management:
- Only work on ONE task from [project-tasks.md](../../docs/project-tasks.md) at a time
- Cross off completed tasks immediately after finishing them
- Never start multiple tasks simultaneously

⚠️ Testing & Development:
- The backend server MUST run in a separate terminal window
- NEVER run the server and test scripts in the same terminal
- Running a test script in the same window where the server is running will kill the server process
- Always open a new terminal tab/window for test scripts
